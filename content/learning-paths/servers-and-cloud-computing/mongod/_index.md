minutes_to_complete: 30   

who_is_this_for: This Learning Path is designed for software developers looking to migrate their MongoDB workloads from x86_64 to Arm-based platforms, specifically on the Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 processors.

learning_objectives: 
    - Provision an Azure Arm64 virtual machine using Azure console, with Ubuntu as the base image.
    - Learn how to create an Azure Linux 3.0 Docker container.
    - Deploy the MongoDb on an Azure Linux 3.0 Arm64-based Docker container and an Azure Linux 3.0 custom-image-based Azure virtual machine.
    - Perform MongoDB baseline testing and benchmarking in both the containerized and virtual machine environments.

prerequisites:
    - A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) account with access to Cobalt 100 based instances (Dpsv6). 
    - A machine with [Docker](/install-guides/docker/) installed.
