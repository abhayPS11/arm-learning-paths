## Cobalt 100 Arm-based processor

Azure’s Cobalt 100 is built on Microsoft's first-generation, in-house Arm-based processor: the Cobalt 100. Designed entirely by Microsoft and based on Arm’s Neoverse N2 architecture, this 64-bit CPU delivers improved performance and energy efficiency across a broad spectrum of cloud-native, scale-out Linux workloads. These include web and application servers, data analytics, open-source databases, caching systems, and more. Running at 3.4 GHz, the Cobalt 100 processor allocates a dedicated physical core for each vCPU, ensuring consistent and predictable performance. 

To learn more about Cobalt 100, refer to the blog [Announcing the preview of new Azure virtual machine based on the Azure Cobalt 100 processor](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurecompute/announcing-the-preview-of-new-azure-vms-based-on-the-azure-cobalt-100-processor/4146353).

## Azure Linux 3.0

Azure Linux 3.0 is Microsoft's in-house, lightweight Linux distribution optimized for running cloud-native workloads on Azure. Designed with performance, security, and reliability in mind, it is fully supported by Microsoft and tailored for containers, microservices, and Kubernetes. With native support for Arm64 (AArch64) architecture, Azure Linux 3.0 enables efficient execution of workloads on energy-efficient Arm-based infrastructure, making it a powerful choice for scalable and cost-effective cloud deployments.

## Nginx

Nginx is a high-performance, open-source web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache. Originally developed by Igor Sysoev, Nginx is known for its event-driven, asynchronous architecture, which enables it to handle high concurrency with low resource usage.

There are three main variants of Nginx:
- **Nginx Open Source**– Free and [open-source version available at nginx.org](https://nginx.org)
- **Nginx Plus**- [Commercial edition of Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/products/nginx/) with features like dynamic reconfig, active health checks, and monitoring.
- **Nginx Unit**-  A lightweight, dynamic application server that complements Nginx. [Learn more at unit.nginx.org](https://unit.nginx.org/).
