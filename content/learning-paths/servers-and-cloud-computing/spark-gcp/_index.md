       - Provision an Arm virtual machine on the Google Cloud Platform using the C4A Google Axion instance family, and RHEL 9 as the base image.
       - Understand how to install and configure Apache Spark on Arm-based GCP C4A instances.
       - Validate the functionality of spark through baseline testing.
       - Perform benchmarking to evaluate Apache Sparkâ€™s performance on Arm.
